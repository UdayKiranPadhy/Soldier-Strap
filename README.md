# Soldier-Strap
This Project has been done during Smart India Hackathon Selection.
This is a group project , Special thanks to (Late)Thrimulesh Sir for guiding and helping us in all possible way.

### Abstract
Monitoring soldier's health condition in real time is a major issues during war , and in very high terrains . In response to it we made a prototype where the Soldier's Health and location is calculate in real time and is monitored.

### Components Required:
1. Arduino Board Uno (2no.)
2. LM35
3. MAX30100
4. SIM808 Module
5. Web Interface and API's in order to display the Information
6. Solar Panels
7. Rechargeable Batteries

### SIM 808 Module Connections

### Working Mechanism:
In the method proposed, the soldier will be wearing a box like component in which all the nessary sensor and module will be placed and the soldier will be monitored . The real time data is sent via internet using SIM808 Module for now, to an IP address of the data server. The data consists of crucial information like the heart rate , oxygen levels and geo location (latitude and longitude). These informatioin is gathered from the sensors LM35 , MAX30100 and locaton from the SIM808 Module. In order to display the data we take the help of API's and we show it in a web interface.

### Advantages:
1. All the soldiers are real time monitored.
2. Authorities can train a soldier if he's find it difficult to sustain in the tarrien .
3. No Physical or manual activation is needed , No human interference is needed.
